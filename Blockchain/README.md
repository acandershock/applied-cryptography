### Compilation + Running
```
python3 main.py
```

### Notes
- The counter is to showcase how hashing can take few or many iterations.
- This program keeps variables from the pass-off server as constants.
- This program also only hashes one block at a time. If you would like to chain multiple blocks, this must be updated in the driver code.
- If you would like to input your own variables, change these values below.

1. quote
2. difficulty parameter (currently set to 24)
3. hash (of previous block)
